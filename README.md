If you have to add a smart capability to Bhairavaâ€™s Bujji (from Kalki2898AD), would you miss the chance? Lets say, we need to build a feature for Bujji. On click of a button, Bujji needs to fetch current weather update of its location and display on its dashboard screen.

One way to achieve this; as soon as Bhairava clicks a button, underlying chip would make an API call, the response details are then parsed to display on an LCD screen. You get the idea, right? 

In this context, **we want you to make an API call and fetch current weather details of Hyderabad.**
